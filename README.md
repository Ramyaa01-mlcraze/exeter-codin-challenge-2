# Task - Students Marksheet (only the Backend)

Taking marks as input for a specific student, display a table with student marks

Create a simple student marksheet system, where we are able to add student details (data
given in the above table), update/delete data. Also show a simple report like the table given
above. NO NEED for an UI. Just have the endpoints created. We could use PostMan to test
these

# Tech Stack and Framework
Use Node JS as the technology stack and Fastify as the web framework (for routes)

# Data Store
Store the data in memory. Use a simple json object to store information.

# Endpoints are created and it can be tested using PostMan.

1. POST/add
2. POST/update
3. DELETE/delete
4. GET/report
